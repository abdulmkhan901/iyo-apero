## Introduction
Hello everyone. Welcome to the Resource Economics(ECON 5211). This course is a continuation of your undergrad course of Natural Resources and Environmental Economics (ECON 4804). This course is divided into two advanced-level courses in Masters; one is Environmental Economics and Resource Economics. So, we can expect the continuation of those courses in this course also. However, with a slightly higher difficulty level. In general, this course can be very mathy, however, my main objective is to make you understand the resources not to teach math. Therefore, we will only do math where it is absolutely necessary.We will have class regularly around 10 am on Wednesday. It will be a 3 hour class with 15 mins of break. You will get the recording of the class but if you do not respond if I ask you a question, you will be regarded as absent from that class. Also, remember your attendance marks is not only attendance marks rather it is attendance and participation marks. So, if you do not participate in the class you can say goodbye to half of your attendance marks. You have to submit your quizzes in grade scope.

## Course aims/Objectives
The interaction between human activity and the world's natural resources involves decisions; we must use natural resources to dwell and produce, but we must also watch how we live and produce in order to safeguard these same natural resources for future generations. This course covers these difficult decisions from an economic standpoint. Resource management models (for forests, fisheries, oil, and natural gas), pollution control models (for air and water pollution), environmental sustainability, and (if time allows) environmental justice are among the themes discussed. There will be a strong focus on economic theory, concepts, and graphs, but public policy applications will also be discussed.



## Course learning outcomes (CLO)
Students will be able to-
-	 learn the tools of economics used to analyze dynamics of renewable and non-renewable resources
-	 To learn about the different models that best describes the models of renewable and non-renewable resourses
-	 To combine students’ expertise in natural and behavioral sciences with basic economic tools.
-	 To explore a selection of environmental issues.
-	Understand the methods of estimating the social value of environmental resources
-	Understand and apply fundamental tools and models of microeconomics to analyzing environmental questions, which involve cases where private market outcomes are not necessarily efficient (e.g., pollution, climate change)
-	Understand and interpret relevant graphical analyses 
-	Understand the intertemporal tradeoffs in environmental issues, and the economic models used to evaluate them
## Learning and teaching activities
This course will bring practical and contemporary materials of environmental economics to the students. This course will include a study tour on which student will learn to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical field. Term paper and assignment of this course will be based on this study tour. Also, students will participate in various classroom activities to get the first hand practical applications of their learning.

## Marks Distribution
There will be 4 quiz tests and best 3 would be counted and it weighs 10% of the total mark. Midterm exam in August will weighs 20% of the marks. Assignment, term paper, presentation and attendance each weigh 5, 7, 3 and 5 percent of the total marks. 
There would be no re-quiz or re-mid. But if you are unable to attend in mid because of some valid physical condition then I will take re-mid. But in that case, you have to inform me about your condition before the midterm exam begins.


## Submission of assessment tasks
All the assignments & term papers must be submitted on time. Late submission will not be accepted. All the assignments should be submitted by following proper rules & structures. 

### Academic Honesty
Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. Any student, who copies another student’s work during an exam, plagiarizes another student’s work, in part or in full, uses unapproved electronic devices, or fails to document outside references will receive an automatic F on the work in question, and may receive an F in the course. Failure to comply with University of
Professional guidelines of academic honesty may result in a failing grade in the course and
further action taken by the university. Please do not attempt to test this guideline.

### Attendance and Classrom Courtesy
Attendance will be taken in class, and attendance is mandatory. When deciding on a student’s participation grade I will primarily consider attendance, classroom participation, proper email usage, and overall classroom behavior. A student’s participation grade will be lowered if they are disruptive during lecture. Disruptions can include cell phone use, text messaging, getting up during lecture, talking, listening to music, arriving late.

### Students with Disabilities
If you have a documented disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course please inform me an advance. Once I am notified I will try my best to ensure your needs are comfortably met for the semester. 

## Contact Information
