## Rationale
The purpose of this course will be equip a student of economics with software skills to run his/her model. This course will use the knowledge of basic statistics and econometrics of a student and teach them how to run those models in different economic softwares like R or Stata. Also, students will learn advanced use of Microsoft word or any typesetting programme such as LaTeX. Students will conversant with the different referencing softwares such as Endnote, Mendeley. Students will learn about the softwares such as ODK, Kobotoolbox to conduct survey online. In short this course will prepare a student, with the practical knowledge to analyze and write results of a research project. 

## Course Objectives
-	Students will be able to use Microsoft word in advance level, that is they will know about automatic referencing with Mendeley/Endnote, cross referencing, auto generated table of contents and figures and many more in Microsoft word
-	Students will learn online based survey in ODK/ Kobotoolbox/ SurveyCTO tools
-	Students will be proficient in a statistical software, either Stata or R
-	In the statistical software students will be conduct different statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, run cross-sectional regressions, build time series models and forecast time series variables
-	Students will also be able to produce publication quality tables in R/Stata and import them in Word or LaTeX
-	Students will know about the basics of data visualizations and will learn to how to do basic data visualization in R/Stata

## Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students should be able to:
-	Use advanced level of Microsoft word
-	Conduct surveys online and in mobile devices
-	Test different statistical hypothesis and run different types of regression
-	Produce publication quality tables
-	Produce figures keeping in mind about the grammar of graphics


## Content
-	Advanced features of Microsoft word: Automatic table of contents, figures, tables, footnote, indexing, track changing in review, commenting, collaborating on a single file, cross-refencing, and simultaneous use of referencing softwares such as Mendeley/Endnote
-	Mendeley/Endnote: Adding files from the drive, adding files from online, how to use with word, manual edit and refencing in different format. 
-	Introduction to LaTeX: Writing equations, paragraphing, spacing, referencing, tables, inserting figures, making publication, use of different packages
-	R/Stata: Introduction the software outlook of R-Studio or Stata, running basic statistical analysis, testing different hypothesis, importing data set, cleaning data set, data wrangling, running liner regressions, logit/probit models, diagnostic testing, time series analysis such as VAR, VECM, ARDL, building ARIMA/SARIMA model and forecast, making publication ready tables, publication ready figures, Grammar of graphics

## Teaching-Learning Strategy
This course uses lectures plus practicals. Students will practice in class on the softwares and do different assignments to learn and be proficient in these softwares. This class will take place in the computer lab. Students can bring their own laptops if they wish to but relevant softwares must be installed beforehand.
