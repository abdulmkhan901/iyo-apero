## Description

This course will focus on the role of the environment in the theory and practice of economics. It will make use of microeconomic analysis at the principle level and will incorporate real-world examples. The class aims to show how environmental externalities cause market failure and economic approach, highlighting many of the tools used by environmental economists including cost-benefit analysis,cost-effectiveness analysis and methods available for monetizing nonmarket goods and services.
Then we will delve into the field of natural resource economics, where we will learn about depletable and renewable energy resources, recyclable resources, water and land as well as forests and fisheries, and other ecosystems.



## Course Objectives
-	Illustrate how economic activities creates an environmental externality
-	How an economist can measure the value of the environment
-	Show how cost-benefit analysis is done
-	How to allocate depletable resources


## Learning Outcomes
-	Understand the methods of estimating the social value of environmental resources
-	Understand and apply fundamental tools and models of microeconomics to analyzing environmental questions, which involve cases where private market outcomes are not necessarily efficient (e.g., pollution, climate change)
-	Understand and interpret relevant graphical analyses 
-	Use microeconomic tools to analyze important environmental regulatory policies 
-	Compare different institutional approaches to environmental policy (regulation, market-based, common law) 
-	Understand the difficulties of formulating and evaluating environmental policy 
-	Understand the history and processes through which environmental policy has been made, and the difficulty of evaluating potentially corrective policies
-	Familiarity with specific economic issues associated with environmental situations
-	Understand the intertemporal tradeoffs in environmental issues, and the economic models used to evaluate them


## Course Materials
### Required Text 
Environmental and Natural Resource Economics 11th Edition, Tom H Tietenberg and Lynne Lewis
Markets and the Environment 2nd Edition, Nathaniel Keohane and Sheila Olmstead

### Optional Text
1.	William Nordhaus, The Climate Casino, any edition, Yale University Press (N) 
2.	Natural resource and environmental economics by Roger Perman
3.	Environmental Economics: An Introduction by Barry c. Field

## Prerequisites 
Knowledge of Principles of Microeconomics (ECON-1101) and simple mathematics like algebra is mandatory. Knowledge of simple calculus like differentiation and integration is a plus point.  As this is an introductory level course for environment economics, we will keep our hands clean from too much abstract mathematics. We will cover mainly graphical approaches and leave more advanced level math stuff for the future graduate level course.
