## Course Rationale
The environment and our natural resources are scarce yet their values are quite hard to determine. Furthermore, there are a variety of problems with the incentives to use them well. Using the tools of microeconomic analysis and some econometrics, this course will define and examine "environmental problems" in terms of economic efficiency. We will also discuss the methods (and shortcomings of these methods) used by economists and policymakers to place dollar values on environmental amenities (since such valuations will determine what policy options are deemed "efficient"), such as benefit-cost analysis. Then we will apply these tools to look at a particular set of environmental problems caused by negative externalities transmitted through naturally occurring amenities, and the effects of the policies we construct in response to these problems.

## Course aims/Objectives
1.	To learn the basic tools of economics used to analyze environmental issues from an efficiency standpoint.
2.	 To learn about the basic tools to environmental issues.
3.	 To combine students’ expertise in natural and behavioral sciences with basic economic tools.
4.	 To explore a selection of environmental issues.

## Course learning outcomes (CLO)
Students will be able to-
-	Understand the methods of estimating the social value of environmental resources
-	Understand and apply fundamental tools and models of microeconomics to analyzing environmental questions, which involve cases where private market outcomes are not necessarily efficient (e.g., pollution, climate change)
-	Understand and interpret relevant graphical analyses 
-	Use microeconomic tools to analyze important environmental regulatory policies 
-	Compare different institutional approaches to environmental policy (regulation, market based, common law) 
-	Understand the difficulties of formulating and evaluating environmental policy 
-	Understand the history and processes through which environmental policy has been made, and the difficulty of evaluating potentially corrective policies
-	Familiarity with specific economic issues associated with environmental situations
-	Understand the intertemporal tradeoffs in environmental issues, and the economic models used to evaluate them


## Learning and teaching activities
This course will bring practical and contemporary materials of environmental economics to the students. This course will include a study tour on which student will learn to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical field. Term paper and assignment of this course will be based on this study tour. Also, students will participate in various classroom activities to get the first hand practical applications of their learning.

## Marks Distribution
There will be 4 quiz tests and best 3 would be counted and it weighs 10% of the total mark. Midterm exam in August will weighs 20% of the marks. Assignment, term paper, presentation and attendance each weigh 5, 7, 3 and 5 percent of the total marks. 
There would be no re-quiz or re-mid. But if you are unable to attend in mid because of some valid physical condition then I will take re-mid. But in that case, you have to inform me about your condition before the midterm exam begins.


## Submission of assessment tasks
All the assignments & term papers must be submitted on time. Late submission will not be accepted. All the assignments should be submitted by following proper rules & structures. 

### Academic Honesty
Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. Any student, who copies another student’s work during an exam, plagiarizes another student’s work, in part or in full, uses unapproved electronic devices, or fails to document outside references will receive an automatic F on the work in question, and may receive an F in the course. Failure to comply with University of
Professional guidelines of academic honesty may result in a failing grade in the course and
further action taken by the university. Please do not attempt to test this guideline.

### Attendance and Classrom Courtesy
Attendance will be taken in class, and attendance is mandatory. When deciding on a student’s participation grade I will primarily consider attendance, classroom participation, proper email usage, and overall classroom behavior. A student’s participation grade will be lowered if they are disruptive during lecture. Disruptions can include cell phone use, text messaging, getting up during lecture, talking, listening to music, arriving late.

### Students with Disabilities
If you have a documented disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course please inform me an advance. Once I am notified I will try my best to ensure your needs are comfortably met for the semester. 

## Contact Information
You can contact me in my office time. If you need to understand something or need to clarify something that may require more than 10 minutes you should take appointment beforehand. After office time you can mail me or you can send me text message, even though I prefer mail.
